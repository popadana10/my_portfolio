# Welcome to My Portfolio!

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. I'm thrilled to share with you the source code for this project, which represents the cumulation of knowledge from my journey through the HTML & CSS course at Business College Helsinki.

## What's Inside?

Inside this repository, you'll find everything you need to dive into my personal portfolio website. From HTML and CSS files defining the structure and styling to JavaScript files adding interactivity, it's all here!
